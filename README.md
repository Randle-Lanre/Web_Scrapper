This a web scrapping python program that makes use of selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape entire item category data off an e-commerce website.
Upon extraction of the data it writes the information into CSV file using some defined headers.

All contributions are welcomed, additional feature would be to import the CSV file to a database preferably an RDBMS.
